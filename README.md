# Graph Theory Project

project developed as an evaluation activity for the Graph Theory discipline at the Federal University of Alagoas.

## Algorithms

- __Dijkstra__
- __Prim__
- __Kosaraju__
- __Kruskal__
- __Floyd-Warshall__

Each algorithm must pass a rigorous battery of tests, tests present in the "Bat1" folder, in addition to a second battery of tests, provided by the teacher in the classroom.
 The Floyd-Warshall algorithm in particular will undergo a battery of tests provided by myself, present in "__BatMANN__" folder, as part of the evaluation. 

## giving execution permission to .sh files

go to the folder where your "file.sh" is located and open the terminal in the folder, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x file.sh
```

Now you can run the file with the command ./file.sh in the terminal.
